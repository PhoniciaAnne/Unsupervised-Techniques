# Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository provides an overview and implementation of several popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Unsupervised learning involves training a model on a dataset without labeled responses. The goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points.
unsupervised doesnot give us particular outputs

## Algorithms Covered

1. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Use Case: Partitioning data into K distinct clusters.
   - Example: Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering**
   - Use Case: Creating a hierarchy of clusters.
   - Example: Grouping genes with similar expression patterns.

3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
   - Use Case: Clustering data with varying densities.
   - Example: Identifying clusters of different shapes and sizes in spatial data.

4. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
   - Use Case: Probabilistic clustering where each cluster is modeled by a Gaussian distribution.
   - Example: Anomaly detection in network traffic.

5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - Use Case: Dimensionality reduction.
   - Example: Reducing the number of features in image compression.

6. **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**
   - Use Case: Separating a multivariate signal into additive, independent components.
   - Example: Blind source separation in signal processing.

7. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
   - Use Case: Visualizing high-dimensional data.
   - Example: Visualizing clusters of handwritten digits.

8. **Autoencoders**
   - Use Case: Data compression and reconstruction.
   - Example: Noise reduction in images.

9. **Apriori Algorithm**
   - Use Case: Association rule learning.
   - Example: Market basket analysis for finding frequent itemsets in transactions.

10. **Isolation Forest**
    - Use Case: Anomaly detection.
    - Example: Detecting fraudulent transactions in financial data.
